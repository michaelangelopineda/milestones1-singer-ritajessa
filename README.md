-   ### 2. Design and Typography

    Overall, the design is simple and clean. The design was based from the artist’s personality and purpose of singing. She wants her website to speak about who she is.

    -   #### a. Colour Scheme

        As per the artist’s description of herself, she is an open, optimistic and approachable and her main purpose in singing is to inspire people. Her genre of music is gospel, which has a soothing and calming effect that affects the brain positively, can elevate your mood, and the lyrics have a way of elevating your spirituality to the next level and helps with your stress level according to [therelativegospel.com](https://tinyurl.com/fhsxnsra). Because of these reasons, we opted to use teal.

        According to [colorpsychology.org](https://tinyurl.com/aahy3z4w), teal (#008080) blends blue’s tranquil stability with green’s optimism and healing properties. Teal is the colour of restfulness and mental and spiritual balance. The calm shade has a natural dignity that is not contrived or “in your face.” Teal’s understated elegance encourages a calm, reflective mood.

        In addition to teal, I used [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23008080&sub=1) to find complementary colours for teal that would maintain overall aesthetic and feel of teal. The colours are listed below:

           -  #008080-teal, RGB value is (0,128,128) blue green  
           -  #00C9CD- RGB value is (0,201,205) mainly blue  
           -  #E6F4F1- RGB value is (230,244,241) Mainly green  
           -  #FF8749-RGB value is (255,135,73), mainly red but appears orange  

        However, we opted to adjust the colours to complement the overall layout and feel of the site and used the following colours instead: 

           -  #008080- solid teal  
           -  #00C9CD- light blue green  
           -  #dde9e6-pale blue green **was changed to #dde9e670 to have a transparent effect against the bg-image**   
           -  #ff8649- pale orange ****was changed to #ff8649a1 to have a transparent effect against the bg-image**    
           -  **#006363- solid dark teal was used to provide contrast against the navbar bg-color**  

        The font colours, which provide contrast to the background, are as follow:

           -  #008080- solid teal **changed to #006363 for better visibility after Lighthouse Testing**   
           -  #E6F4F1- light teal  
           -  #FF8749- solid orange  
           -  #ffffff- white   
                
    -   #### b. Typography
  
        The fonts used are [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=MY%20MUSIC%20l%20MY%20VIDEO%20l%20MY%20PHOTOS&preview.text_type=custom&preview.size=29&sort=popularity&preview.layout=row#standard-styles) for headings and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=MY%20MUSIC%20l%20MY%20VIDEO%20l%20MY%20PHOTOS&preview.text_type=custom&preview.size=29&sort=popularity&preview.layout=row&query=robot) for all written content with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

        Poppins and Roboto are clean fonts used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

    -   #### c. Imagery
        
        The images used in the site are provided by the artist and her photographer. 
        
        The background-image, which is a white-gray marble tile, was taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/marble-surface-2341290/) and gives a simple and fresh look together with the adjusted background-colors of each sections. 
        
        The hero-image was edited in [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/sp/design/post/urn:aaid:sc:AP:fdef19ec-0d82-4ef5-9522-01c05cf49f31?_branch_match_id=922094833261166892) and was designed to give pique the interest of the viewers and catch their attention with its very simple yet effective design.

        Lastly, the sizes of the images were adjusted to ensure balance with the other elements.

    -   #### d. Media (Recordings and video)

        The recordings were provided by the artist. These are gospels songs which reflect the kind of music she wants to do.

        On the other hand, the size music video in the My New Release of Home Page was adjusted to ensure balance with the other elements.
        
        Users has the option to click the play button of the audio and video element should they want to view the video.
