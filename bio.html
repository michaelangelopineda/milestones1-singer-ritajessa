                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    Rita Jessa is a 30-year-old lady, currently living and working full-time as a nurse in Ireland. She
                    is originally from the Philippines and had been a nurse for quite some time. She loves music and
                    meeting up with friends, and two words to describe this young lady is she’s very religious and
                    inspirational. The Almighty had always been the centre of her life and she never fails to see
                    situations with a silver lining. Her positive outlook in life draws a lot of people from different
                    walks of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In her free time, she would usually read very interesting books or get in touch with her family and
                    friends in the Philippines. She definitely is a people person and treasures her friends and family
                    greatly.
                </p>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    She was born in Iloilo, a province which is located in the centre of the Philippine archipelago. It
                    was given the title of “Queen City of the South” for being the Philippine’s second city, after
                    Manila. Growing up in Iloilo, she has acquired this charm and sweetness that is very native among
                    the people of Iloilo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She migrated to Ireland to seek for greener pastures and upon coming to Ireland, she has
                    continuously served in the church and participated in the service as a member of the choir.
                </p>
                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>
                    Music has always had been one of her passion. She has been gifted with this angelic voice that will
                    soothe and comfort your ears. She started singing at an early age and despite having no formal
                    training, her natural talent developed and has been giving joy to a lot of her acquaintance and
                    family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She decided to pursue her music career as a calling. She believes that her voice will move a number
                    of peoples’ heart and encourage them to be more thankful and appreciative of life. Her songs are
                    currently ‘covers’ only but in the future, she hopes to deliver original compositions that would
                    delight, inspire and bring people closer to the Almighty.
                </p>
