- Collapse hamburger menu for navbar is not showing on mobile view and carousel effect not working despite adding the bootstrap5 links. *Fixed*  
    - Changed the `<script>` right before the `<body>` to the older version of Bootstrap4.5.3  

- Upon adding the [background-image](docs/issues-img/bg-img-issue.png) of the page, all the elements compressed and aligned horizontally instead of vertically, thereby disrupting the flow of the content. *Fixed*  
    - It was solved by editing the css declaration for `.bg-image`  

- There was a [`gitpush error`](docs/issues-img/git-push-error-issue.png) when doing the initial part of the project. *Fixed*  
    - I had to open a new workspace in gitpod and copy-paste all initial codes. Also, all the media items were compressed to fit the recommended size allowance.  

- The width of the [audio element's size](docs/issues-img/audio-issue.png) is non-responsive. *Fixed*  
    - It was fixed by adding `width: 10em` css.  

- Boostrap5 link in the head element and Bootstrap4.5.3 in the body element. *Fixed*  
   -  Reconcile all bootstrap version in html document. Changed bootstrap link to `    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
        integrity="sha384-TX8t27EcRE3e/ihU7zmQxVncDAy5uIKz4rEkgIXeMed4M0jlfIDPvg6uqKI2xXr2" crossorigin="anonymous">`  in the head element  

- Font color of links when opening the website is white. *Fixed*  
    - It was solved by deleting the pseudo class :link; in the navbar in css.  

- At 992px width in Chrome Dev Tool, the [background color](docs/issues-img/navbar-bg-color-issue.png) appearing in navbar is similar to the color of the navigation menu on toggle mode. *Fixed*  
    - It was fixed using media query `@media only screen and (max-width: 991.98px)`  

- White space in the Contact Page and Feedback Form Sent Page big devices. *Fixed*
    - Adjusted padding and margin to push the content down to get rid of the whitespace as discussed with tutor support. I tried to target the footer element and body using css but wasnt not working.
